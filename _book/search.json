Now, set that window aside for later.\nI typically find it helpful to create an ssh key for saving time. First, I navigate to my .ssh directory on the local machine and provide a unique name to the output to help manage the multiple keys for different organizations. When prompted for a passphrase, do not provide one as this will cause some issues with the MFA system of the HPC. After creating the key pair, you can edit the config file to provide a shortcut name.\nIn the config file, add the following lines, replacing UNITY_ID with your real one.\nYou will now have two files appear in the directory, ncsursa and ncsursa.pub. You will need to add the contents of your public (*.pub) file to your list of authorized keys on the HPC (remote). Simply open the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the HPC and copy-paste the public key line there. Save all files and close both terminal windows. You should now be able to prompt a login with ssh ncsu.",
